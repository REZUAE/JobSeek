# Introduction
The Job Portal project is a web application developed using Python and Django framework. It aims to provide a platform for job seekers to search and apply for job opportunities, as well as for employers to post job vacancies and manage applications. The project utilizes the powerful features of Django to create a robust and user-friendly job port
# Use Case
The Job Portal project serves a variety of use cases for both job seekers and employers. These use cases are designed to cater to the specific needs of each user group. Here's a detailed explanation of the primary use cases for job seekers and employers:

Job Seekers:
Search Jobs: Job seekers can utilize the search functionality to look for job opportunities based on different criteria such as location, job title, industry, and salary range. The system provides relevant and filtered results, making it easier for users to find suitable job listings.
Apply for Jobs: Once job seekers find a job listing that matches their interests and qualifications, they can apply for it. The application process typically involves submitting an updated resume and a personalized cover letter to express their interest and suitability for the position.
Save Jobs: Users have the ability to save job listings that they find interesting or want to consider in the future. This feature allows them to revisit those listings later for further review or to submit applications.
Job Alerts: Job seekers can set up job alerts based on their preferred criteria. These alerts notify them via email about relevant job openings that match their specified preferences, ensuring they stay updated on potential opportunities.

Employers:
Post Jobs: Employers can create and post job vacancies on the job portal. They can provide comprehensive details such as job title, job description, required qualifications, location, and application deadline. Posting jobs allows employers to reach a wide pool of potential candidates.
Manage Applications: Employers have access to a dashboard or interface where they can view and manage job applications received for their posted job listings. They can review applicant profiles, resumes, and cover letters, shortlist candidates, schedule interviews, and communicate with applicants directly through the portal.
Employer Profile: Employers have dedicated profiles within the job portal. These profiles allow them to showcase their company information, including the company name, logo, and other relevant details. Having an employer profile helps in establishing a strong brand presence and attracting potential candidates.

By offering these use cases, the Job Portal project provides a comprehensive platform that connects job seekers with employers. It enables job seekers to search and apply for suitable job opportunities while allowing employers to efficiently manage their job listings and applications. The project aims to facilitate a seamless and effective job search and recruitment process for both parties involved.

# Technologies used
Python: The primary programming language used for developing the project. Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support.
Django: A high-level Python web framework that provides a structured and efficient development environment. Django offers built-in features for handling user authentication, database connectivity, URL routing, and template rendering.
HTML/CSS: The project uses HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring the web pages and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for defining the visual styles and layout of the application.
JavaScript: JavaScript is used to enhance the interactivity and functionality of the web pages. It enables dynamic content updates, form validations, and asynchronous operations.
Django ORM: Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) simplifies database operations by allowing developers to interact with the database using Python objects and methods. It abstracts away the underlying SQL queries and provides a convenient API for querying and manipulating data.
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS): The project utilizes a relational database to store and manage data. Popular options include PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. The choice of the database depends on the specific requirements and scalability needs of the project.
Django Templates: Django's template engine is used for generating dynamic HTML pages. It allows for the separation of HTML code from the application logic and facilitates the rendering of dynamic data within the templates.
Django Forms: Django's form handling framework is used for processing and validating user input. It provides a convenient way to create and handle HTML forms, perform form validations, and handle form submissions.
Django Authentication System: The built-in authentication system provided by Django is used for user registration, login, and session management. It ensures secure user authentication and protects user data.
Django Admin: Django's administration interface is used for managing the application's backend. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing administrative tasks such as managing users, job listings, applications, and other entities.
